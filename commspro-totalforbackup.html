<h2 class="has-text-color" style="color:#23527c">COMMUNICATIONS FOR EVERY STAGE OF RUC</h2>
As a communications professional, you play an important role in the success of your state’s RUC program. Effective communications can help address concerns about RUC, close information gaps, and describe RUC program objectives. Talking to stakeholders and the public about a new funding concept can be uniquely challenging. To help you navigate the process, we’ve broken down RUC communications considerations for each stage of RUC.

In the <span style="color: #67b059;font-weight: bold">Research &amp; Planning</span> stage, your communications team will focus on creating a communications plan that defines clear goals and objectives for RUC in your state and gathering input. As part of this process, think through how to engage the public, stakeholders, and the media. Tactics may include performing research about other RUC programs in the country, forming study groups, meeting with stakeholders, conducting public opinion research, and performing additional communications activities. In the Setup stage, your communications team will focus on developing a cohesive strategy to support a live RUC program. This means broader outreach to the general public, clear and consistent messaging, and strong coordination with the partner agencies that will share in implementation. You can build on any communications and research you started in the Research &amp; Planning stage, or pivot as needed to adjust for evolving needs. You may find that you need to do more research to get the current pulse of the state as well as create additional materials to reflect the latest data. Finally, develop materials--like a website, FAQs, fact sheets, or social media posts--to help the public learn more about the new program.

Some best practices to keep in mind:
