<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">What is a road usage charge?</h4>
<p>A road usage charge is a per-mile charge drivers would pay based on how much they use Washington’s road system rather than pay by the gallons of gas they buy. This approach is similar to how people pay for their utilities, including electricity or water.</p>

<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">Why is Washington state studying a road usage charge system?</h4>
<p><strong>To ensure sustainable, long-term funding:</strong> As vehicles become more fuel efficient, gas consumption goes down. With a decline in gas consumption comes reduced gas tax revenues needed for our roads, bridges, and ferry system. A road usage charge could provide a more stable source of transportation funding than the gas tax, since drivers would pay by the mile instead of by the gallon.</p>

<!-- <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-36392" src="https://waroadusagecharge.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/WA-RUC-Graphs-Gas-Tax.png" alt="graph compares the revenue that is generated per mile based on vehicle fuel efficiency" width="5476" height="4309" longdesc="/gas-tax-graph-longdesc" /> -->

<p><strong>To ensure everyone pays their fair share:</strong> Considering the range of MPG of today’s vehicles on the road, the gas tax has become inequitable. For the same miles driven, drivers pay widely different amounts for their roadway use, depending on their vehicle’s MPG. This inequity is expected to grow each year as vehicle MPG continues to increase.</p>
<div id="additional-tax"></div>
<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">Will this be an additional tax?</h4>
<p>No, the road usage charge is being considered as a replacement to the gas tax, not on top of or in addition to the gas tax. In Washington, a transition to a gas tax would be gradual – more like a dial than a switch. Drivers of electric and hybrid vehicles would be the first to use a road usage charge in Washington. During this gradual transition, no drivers would ever be taxed twice – they would only pay either a RUC or the gas tax.</p>

<div id="mid-sized"> </div>
<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">When the RUC is in place and the state moves away from the gas tax, how will I be reimbursed for the gas tax that is paid at the pump? </h4>
<p>During the period where the state establishes a RUC system and a gas tax is still in place, gas taxes paid at the pump will be a pre-payment of the road usage charge. This pre-payment approach was successful during the RUC pilot, which began in 2018, where the WA RUC system issued credits to drivers for any gas tax they paid when filling up at the pump. </p>



<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">Will the road usage charge be a flat rate?</h4>
<p>If the legislature decides to move forward with some form of a road usage charge, they will have the opportunity to consider how a rate system would work. This could include implementing additional polices to balance the impact of RUC, including establishing different per mile rates according to vehicle weight, vehicle engine type, vehicle emissions, or other criteria the legislature establishes. This kind of flexibility is not present under today’s gas tax structure. </p>

<p>For purposes of the road usage charge pilot we conducted in 2017-2018, we utilized a 2.4 cents per-mile mock charge across all vehicles statewide, which is equivalent to what the average car (20.5 mpg) in our state currently pays under the 49.4 cent per gallon gas tax. No real payments were made in the 2017-2018 pilot. </p>


<div id="hybrid"> </div>
<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">How much would a road usage charge cost me each year?</h4>

<p>Assuming the average vehicle per year travels 12,000 miles, this breaks down to 1,000 miles traveled per month. If we apply the road usage charge pilot’s rate of 2.4 cents per mile, this equates to a total of $24 per month, or $288 on an annual basis. Currently, drivers pay an average of $289.17 a year under the gas tax. </p>

<p>What you drive will determine the cost impact of RUC: </p>
<ul>
<li>Less fuel-efficient vehicles will see a decrease in the amount of taxes paid. </li>
<li>More fuel-efficient vehicles will see an increase in the amount of taxes paid.  </li>
<li>The total effect is that all drivers pay the same rate to use the roads – regardless of their vehicle’s MPG. </li>
</ul>
<p>While RUC does result in drivers of fuel-efficient vehicles paying a little more in taxes for transportation as compared to the gas tax, the overall cost advantage of owning a fuel efficient, hybrid, or EV remains significant. For example, under RUC, owners of a Prius will pay $210 dollars per month less than the Ford pickup truck driver. </p>


<div id="rural-driver"> </div>
<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">As a rural driver, I have to drive more to have access to needed services and amenities. Am I really going to pay less than I do now under a gas tax? </h4>
<p>Two studies looking at Washington state and the Western US have explored whether a potential transition from the gas tax to a RUC would disproportionately impact rural households. </p>

<ul>

    <li> Generally, rural residents drive older, less fuel-efficient vehicles, which increases gas taxes.   </li>
    <li> Rural drivers tend to travel longer distances per trip but drive less frequently than urban drivers. </li>
    <li> In Washington, rural households are expected to pay 4.8% less and urban households will pay 1.0% more state tax under a RUC system compared with the current gas tax.  </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2" id="drive-out-of-state">What happens if I drive out of state?</h4>
<p>Miles driven out of state was explored in the 2017-2018 pilot study and will continue to be refined with additional research opportunities in the fall and winter of 2022-2023. In the 2017-2018 pilot, one way that drivers could ensure they were not charged for miles driven out of state was by selecting the GPS-enabled plug-in device or smartphone app options for reporting miles. These two options utilized GPS to ensure drivers were only charged for miles they drove in Washington. The State of Washington did not store or record specific location data – and would also not store location information in a future RUC system. Only the total number of miles driven in state and on public roads was recorded.</p>

<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2" id="without-gps">Can miles be reported without using GPS data?</h4>
<p>Yes – Washington has tested multiple options for recording RUC mileage, inducing options that do not reply on GPS data. In the previous pilot, participants were able to pick how they recorded their miles from four options: a mileage permit, odometer readings, an automated mileage meter, or smartphone app. Each of these methods required a different method for recording and reporting data. The mileage permit and odometer reading approaches did not require any technology or GPS to utilize; however, these methods did not distinguish between miles driven inside and outside of the state. In a future RUC system, low or no tech (and no GPS options) would be available for driver to record miles driven. </p>

<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2" id="without-gps">If a RUC program is put in place in the future, will the per-mile rate be adjusted based on vehicle weight?</h4>
<p>If the legislature decides to implement a road usage charge in the future, they will have to decide how to address different types of vehicles, personal trucks, small cars, and motorcycles. One of the unique aspects of a road usage charge is that, if implemented, it could allow state policymakers to set different road usage charge rates depending on different factors, such as vehicle weight, engine type or other variables. This kind of flexibility is not present under today’s gas tax structure. </p>

<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2" id="what-is-pilot">What is a pilot project?</h4>
<p>Washington’s 2017-2018 road usage charge pilot project was a small-scale, short-term study that gave drivers in Washington the chance to experience different approaches to road usage charging. While it was a simulation of what a real system might be like, it gave drivers the chance to provide feedback and share their thoughts and experience with decision makers. The pilot project will also help decision makers better understand the pros and cons of this approach to funding our transportation system statewide. The previous pilot demonstrated that Washington is ready for a RUC system, with some additional research and policy refinements. This research and refinements will be conducted in small-scale research in fall/winter 2022-2023. </p>

<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">Do participants in the pilot project have to pay real money?</h4>
<p>No, participation is free—no real payments are required. </p>


<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">How much of a time commitment is it to participate?</h4>

<p>The basic pilot experience is a one-time commitment approximately 30 minutes. Depending on your answers in the RUC simulation, you may be invited to participate in one of three “follow-on” experiences. These include a set of tasks to gather more information about how you drive and could take up to a few hours of your time over several months.</p>

<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">Will participants be compensated for participating?</h4>
<p>Yes, participants will receive a modest stipend for participating in the RUC pilot and follow-on experiences.</p>


<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">What research questions will be answered in the pilot?</h4>
<p>Current research is focused in the following areas: </p>
<ul> 
    <li> Innovation – How can technology, market innovations, and design improve Washingtonians’ experience with RUC? </li>
    <li> Cost-effectiveness – How can we make the cost to the state of collecting a RUC as low as possible?   </li>
    <li> Equity – How can we make sure that a RUC program is fair for all Washington drivers? </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">How do I sign up?</h4>
<p>You can participate in our research by signing up <a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7061065/WARUCrecruit" target="_blank"> here.</a>  </p>

<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">Am I eligible to participate?</h4>
<p>We have limited slots for volunteers in our current pilot. We are seeking a diverse set of participants from across the state. Eligibility is primarily determined by whether you own or lease the vehicle you currently drive; we are unable to work with volunteers who are renting or borrowing a vehicle. </p>

<h4 class="page-subheader-teal2">Do I need a computer, smart phone, or access to internet?</h4>
<p>Yes. To participate in the research phase, you will need access to a computer or smart phone that can connect to the internet. </p> <br><br><br>
