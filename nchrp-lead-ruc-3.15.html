     <p>With the push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, many states have adopted clean energy and climate change policies. States approaches to meet clean energy and climate change goals may include promoting sales of electric vehicles through rebates or tax credits, or more aggressive tactics like restricting the sale of gas-powered vehicles after a certain date. Additionally, some auto manufacturers, like Ford and GM, have pledged to convert their fleets to all-electric. These initiatives can directly impact transportation funding and create a more imminent need for an alternative revenue mechanism like RUC.</p>
     <p>As of May 2022, 20 states have passed or were considering passing EV adoption goals and/or bans on gas-powered vehicles. All of these states have set EV adoption targets over the next 10 to 20 years. Washington and California have the most aggressive active policies, restricting all new light-duty vehicle sales to zero-emission vehicles or EVs by 2030 and 2035, respectively.</p>
<p>Clean energy policies and increases in EV ownership are great for the environment and public health, but greatly impact highway funding that relies on the purchase of fuel. These policies hasten the need for states to address the resulting revenue impacts. As states move towards reaching their EV adoption goals and ban the sale of gasoline or diesel vehicles, they will need to consider how they transition away from the fuel tax as the primary source of roadway funding and move towards alternative sources of transportation revenue. The more aggressive the clean energy policy, the more urgent it will be for the state to address the issue.</p>
<p>The RUC implementation strategy for these states could range from a voluntary RUC program in lieu of paying any special registration fees that may be in place for these vehicles to a mandate for all EVs to pay a RUC. However, charging a RUC on EVs could create a public acceptance issue as it is perceived to be a policy that is contrary to EV adoption goals. This is less of a concern in states where a special EV registration fee is already in place and where RUC is being introduced as an alternative to the fee.  Low mileage EV drivers find a RUC to be more equitable than a flat fee.</p>

    <p>Even if your state does not have EV adoption goals or clean energy policies, there are other factors that may impact the fuel efficiency of your state’s vehicle fleet – and that therefore may impact the need for an alternative to the fuel tax. </p>
    <p>For example, the federal government has imposed stricter fuel efficiency standards on gas-powered vehicles by establishing corporate average fuel economy standards, requiring passenger vehicles to have an industry-wide fleet average of 49 miles per gallon (MPG) in 2026. At the same time, some auto manufacturers, like Ford and General Motors, have pledged to convert their fleets to all-electric. These initiatives can directly impact transportation funding and create a more imminent need for an alternative revenue mechanism like RUC.</p>
<p>Developing and analyzing economic forecasts can be important for determining the impact of greater fuel efficiency in your state, as well as how a RUC can account for these trends.</p>

<p>Highway funding policy varies from state to state. Each state has a varying degree of reliance on the fuel tax for roadway funding, as well as varying reliance on complementary road funding concepts such as tolling, heavy vehicle charging, or vehicle-based fees such as EV surcharges. States also vary in the ways they use other sources, such as sales taxes or general fund transfers, for roadway funding. Understanding this dimension, a state's current transportation funding portfolio informs how states might move forward with RUC and which strategies could be most effective for implementation. </p>
<p>States rely on a similar mix of funding sources for their highway funding. As of May 2022, the largest sources—aside from federal funding and borrowing—include fuel taxes (32% on average), vehicle registration fees (25%), and tolls (13%). The remaining 30% comes from a wide variety of sources such as dedicated sales taxes, general fund transfers, and rental car taxes.</p>
<p> The figure illustrates the breakdown of revenue sources as of May 2022 (excluding federal funds and bonding), broken into fuel taxes, tolls, vehicle fees, general fund transfers, and “other.” The “other” category encompasses a wide range of sources, such as sales taxes, rental car taxes, and sources specific to one or a few states, like oil and gas severance taxes in Texas.  As gas tax revenues have declined, some states have begun shifting more of their funding to vehicle fees and other sources. Conduct additional research to verify that these numbers are still valid as you begin the data gathering process.</p>

</figure>
<p>Thirty states impose special registration fees for plug-in EVs. Almost half of these states also impose a fee for plug-in hybrid vehicles. The fees are typically assessed to compensate for EVs not paying gas tax. Fees for conventional (non-electric) hybrid vehicles range from $20 to $100.</p>
<p>In some states, heavy vehicles are subject to weight distance taxes or truck-only tolling. The taxes and the heavy vehicles subject to them vary by state. Four states currently (May 2022) collect weight-distance taxes, including Kentucky, Oregon, New Mexico, and New York. In 2021, Connecticut enacted a weight-mile tax that is scheduled to begin in 2023.</p>
<p>Weight-distance taxes are assessed on a per-mile basis with the rate varying by vehicle weight and number of axles. The tax is intended to compensate for additional wear and tear on roadways by heavier vehicles. States’ rates and subject vehicle definitions differ. In Oregon and New Mexico, vehicles over 26,000 pounds must report and pay weight-mile taxes, whereas in New York, vehicles over 18,000 pounds are subject and only those over 59,999 pounds are subject in Kentucky. Oregon’s weight-mile tax is the most mature program and collects the greatest amount of revenue. Notably, trucks paying the weight-mile tax in Oregon do not pay taxes on diesel fuel. Rhode Island has implemented a truck-only toll on all major highways and bridges.</p>
<p>As the vehicle fleet shifts to more fuel-efficient vehicles and EVs, states will experience different levels of impacts on their current funding depending on their portfolio of revenue sources. States that rely more heavily on fuel taxes for highway funding will have a more urgent need to shift to other revenue sources than states who rely more on vehicle-based charges like registration fees or tolls. RUC is the only alternative that preserves the usage-based component to transportation funding. States with weight-mileage taxes and special registration fees for certain vehicles like EVs may be able to leverage these programs in their transition to RUC. For example, vehicles could opt to pay a RUC in lieu of the special registration fees.</p>

<p>Some states charge a weight-mileage fee or EV-specific registration fees to supplement fuel tax revenue.</p>
<p>Usually levied on commercial vehicles, weight-mileage fee is a per-mile rate that is based on the vehicle’s weight. As of 2022, 4 states collect weight-mileage fees.</p>
<p> As of 2022, 30 states impose special registration fees for plug-in EVs. Almost half of these states also impose a fee for plug-in hybrid vehicles. The fees are typically assessed to compensate for EVs not paying gas tax.</p>
If your state does not utilize weight-mileage or EV-specific registration fees, it may rely more heavily on fuel taxes for highway funding. In that case, there may be a more urgent need to shift to other revenue sources than states who rely more on vehicle-based charges like weight-mileage or registration fees.<p></p>

           <p>Public education and acceptance are critical components to the success of any RUC program. If a state recently increased their fuel tax or passed a major revenue package, the public may be more aware of the funding issues facing the state as a result of education efforts to get these passed. This can either help or hurt the success of introducing a RUC. Members of the public could question the need for a new funding option as they don’t perceive the problem still exists if a major revenue package or gas tax increase was just passed. On the other hand, if members of the public and legislature understand why the fuel tax is not sustainable, they can better understand that increasing it is only a short-term solution. Recent attention to transportation funding could also impact political will to support other funding mechanisms. The messaging about RUC to the public, stakeholders, and policymakers will look different for states that have had recent success with fuel tax increases or major revenue packages and those that have not.</p>
<p>Between 2015 and 2022, 25 states plus Washington, D.C., have increased their fuel tax, and 11 states currently index their fuel tax to inflation. Sixteen states have not increased their fuel tax in over a decade. In addition, 26 states and Washington, D.C., have passed major funding packages since 2015, most of which included a fuel tax increase. Six of these packages would generate more than $1 billion annually, five would generate between $400 and $900 million annually, and six would generate between $100 and $400 million annually.</p>
<p> If your state has recently completed public education and/or public opinion research about transportation, this information can be leveraged to develop a successful messaging strategy around RUC.</p>

            <p>Research across the U.S. has shown that people generally don’t know how transportation is funded, how much they currently pay for transportation, or why the current funding model is not sustainable. As a result, the public does not perceive a transportation funding problem, making it challenging to discuss new funding mechanisms. Helping the public understand the problem, the inability of the fuel tax to keep up with road maintenance needs, and how a RUC could provide a more sustainable transportation revenue stream, can improve the public’s willingness to learn more about the concept. </p>

        <p>The exploration of RUC as an alternative transportation funding mechanism has been underway in the United States since the early 2000s. </p>
<p>As of May 2022, Oregon, Utah and Virginia are the only states to have legislatively enacted voluntary RUC programs where eligible vehicle owners can opt-in to the RUC program and pay a RUC in lieu of paying special registration fees and/or fuel taxes. Connecticut has enacted a RUC for heavy vehicles. Ten states have conducted or are conducting pilots and five states are currently in the research stage. Several states are learning from those around them through their memberships in multi-state consortiums like RUC America (a consortium of 19 state DOTs who work together sharing best practices, ideas, and information on RUC) and The Eastern Transportation Coalition (a partnership of 18 states and DC focused on the future of transportation).

       <p>State governments use three primary methods to determine how revenue can be used: constitutional restrictions, statutory revenue restrictions, and budget decisions. In many states, these methods are used to dedicate most, if not all, of a state’s transportation revenue solely for transportation purposes or highway-related purposes. The ease with which each method can be enacted or repealed to restrict the use of revenue varies, along with the duration of that restriction.</p>
<figure style="margin-left: 3em">

<figcaption>A few words about the image above, if applicable. (Click on image to expand)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> First, constitutional restrictions involve amending the state constitution to restrict the use of certain revenue for transportation purposes. In states that have a constitutional amendment, it is most often used to restrict fuel tax revenue for use on roads and bridges. A constitutional amendment is the most challenging restriction to use, because it often requires a two-thirds vote of the legislature, sometimes in multiple legislative sessions, and then an affirmative vote of the people. </p>
<p>Next, statutory restrictions require a legislature to pass laws that narrowly define how revenue can be spent. These restrictions are codified in statute and often only require a majority vote by the legislature; however, they exist in statute until they are repealed. </p>
<p>Finally, budget decisions are also used to direct where and how certain funds are used. In most states, legislatures develop and enact a state transportation budget, which codifies where and how transportation funds will be used. It operates the same as a statutory restriction; however, because budgets only bind the current legislature, a new legislature is free to develop and enact a new budget. Therefore, the restrictions developed through a budget process generally last two years. These constitutional, statutory, and budgetary restrictions on how transportation revenue sources can be spent are important to understand when evaluating options for RUC implementation. </p>
<p>When developing the implementation of a RUC system, it is important to understand the constitutional and statutory (or legal) restrictions on how various highway funding sources can be spent and who can collect the fees (e.g., vendors on behalf of the state). The legislature must decide where revenue from the RUC system will be directed and whether there should be any restrictions on the use of RUC revenues (e.g., all transportation projects or just roads and bridges). There tends to be broad public support for restricting transportation revenues and RUC to transportation projects. If there is already a constitutional provision or amendment restricting fuel tax revenue to transportation projects, changes may need to be made to ensure that RUC revenue is included in that constitutional guarantee. Generally, limitations on the use of revenue are not an obstacle to implementing a RUC program.</p>

        <p>As of 2022, all states except Alaska have some level of requirement that motor fuel taxes must be spent on transportation. Across the country, a constitutional amendment limiting expenditure of fuel tax revenue for strictly highway purposes is the most common spending restriction, with 24 states having passed an amendment. Most of these states also restrict the expenditure of other motor vehicle–related taxes and fees, especially vehicle and driver license fees. Nearly half of U.S. states—22—have constitutional restrictions barring the gas tax from supporting public transportation. Sixteen states have statutory restrictions on the use of fuel tax revenue. </p>
<p>Fewer restrictions on how transportation-related revenue is spent may allow for more policy options to be considered when implementing RUC.</p>

       <p>State requirements for the enactment of new taxes or tax increases vary. In some states, a simple legislative majority can approve a new tax and/or a tax increase, while in others a supermajority is required. Further, the definition of supermajority varies among states. For example, supermajority can require a two-thirds, three-fifths, or a three-fourths majority. Some states even require approval by voters. Understanding these tax enactment requirements is critical to determining how a RUC could interact with a state’s existing laws and, ultimately, be implemented.</p> 
<p>In 34 states and Washington (as of 2022), D.C., the legislature can enact new taxes or increase existing taxes with a simple majority vote. The table below shows that 15 states require a supermajority vote, five states require a three-fifths majority, seven states require a two-thirds majority, and three states require a three-fourths majority. Most states’ supermajority requirements apply to all taxes, but there are exceptions in three states as noted in the table. In Colorado, all new taxes or tax increases require voter approval, except in the case of emergencies.</p>

<p>The ability to pass RUC legislation is directly impacted by the legislative requirements to enact a new tax. Having RUC champions in the legislature as well as knowledgeable staff who help legislators stay informed, work through the process, and address important questions and concerns related to RUC can help with passing RUC-enabling legislation.</p>

        <p>In most cases where RUC revenues are used for general transportation purposes, RUC is likely to be considered a tax, and not simply a fee (although in states such as Utah, RUC is currently considered a fee because it is paid in lieu of the alternative fuel vehicle fee). </p>
       <p>Whether a charge is characterized as a tax or fee has statutory and constitutional implications. The power to tax is vested in the legislature, which has broad authority to do so. The authority to impose a fee is narrower in scope and invokes the government’s ability to regulate certain activities. While a fee is often more politically palatable, it may not always be sufficient to implement a policy involving a financial levy that applies to nearly every person.</p>
<p>Performing a legal analysis may be important for determining which policy paths are available in your state.</p>

      <p>Vehicle safety or emissions inspections could be leveraged for a RUC by using the inspection data for RUC recording, reporting, and true-up. This would work particularly well for states that have an annual safety inspection that already includes odometer data collection, because minimal changes would be required to existing processes. </p>
<p>Vehicle inspection requirements vary widely across the states, including the type of inspection, frequency, subject vehicles, and data collected. This guidebook focuses on whether the various existing state vehicle inspections could be leveraged for RUC, resulting in the following categories:</p>
<li>Odometer reading collected via annual safety inspection</li>
<li>Emissions inspection required for all vehicles</li>
<li>Emissions inspection required for most vehicles</li>
<li>Emission inspection required for &lt;50% of vehicles</li>
<li>No or insufficient safety or emissions inspection for RUC</li>
<p>As of 2022, 14 states have annual safety inspections where the vehicle’s odometer reading is collected as part of the inspection. Eighteen states do not have any vehicle inspections, or the inspection is insufficient for the purposes of RUC due to infrequency of the inspections and/or minimal vehicles subject to the inspections.</p>
<p>In states where they are required, emissions inspections are typically required every second year. New Jersey, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C., require emissions inspections for all vehicles, whereas other states with vehicle emissions inspections only require them for a geographical subset of vehicles. For states requiring emissions inspections for a geographical subset of vehicles, the utility of the inspections for RUC collection will vary based on the percentage of vehicles covered. </p>
<p>Additional RUC reporting options will need to be offered for vehicles not subject to the vehicle inspections or in the years when a vehicle inspection is not required.</p>

       <p>Common concerns raised by the public about a RUC are related to geographic equity. Many worry that rural drivers would end up paying more because they drive more miles, or that people who have long commutes and limited or no access to public transportation will be penalized. Another concern is the ability of a RUC to capture revenues from out-of-state drivers. This consideration focuses on the geographic features of states, including urban and rural populations and the potential for cross-border travel with other states and countries.</p>
<p>The framework for evaluating how a state’s geographic features could influence RUC implementation is primarily based on the state’s border-to-area ratio and rural/urban population percentages. For the purposes of this guidebook, the following categories were developed:</p>
<ul class="lr-ul">
<li>Medium to large states with fewer borders and mostly rural populations </li>
<li>Medium states with several borders and a mixed rural/urban population</li>
<li>Medium to small states with many borders and a more rural populace</li>
<li>Large states with few borders and mostly urban population </li>
<li>Smaller, highly urbanized states with many borders</li>
<li>Unique (Hawaii) </li>
</ul>
<p>The figure below shows the percentage of states in each geographic category. The majority of states are medium states with several borders and a mixed rural/urban population (e.g., Kansas, Minnesota, Washington, Virginia) or medium to large states with fewer borders and larger rural populations (e.g., Iowa, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Wyoming). Many Eastern U.S. states are medium or small states with many borders, which can mean more frequent cross-state travel. Indeed, cross-state travel is significant in the Eastern U.S., where 2018 to 2021 RUC pilots saw that 10% to 20% of participants’ miles were driven outside of their home state. </p>

<p> The research and communication about RUC must be sensitive to the geographic characteristics of the state, because people who live in different geographic areas react differently to RUC and generally have concerns that are unique to their area. These geographic-specific concerns need to be taken into consideration and require significant public education and outreach. </p>
<p> To account for the needs of rural drivers, for example, technology used in a RUC system could be used to charge only for miles driven on public roads, making miles driven on private farms and ranches free of charge. Additionally, public fear that RUC is inequitable for those with longer commutes may need to be addressed. The Distributional Impacts Analysis building block delves deeper into these geographic-specific challenges and the strategies for addressing them.</p>

      <p>A significant challenge with the implementation of a RUC system is its interplay with other states.

      <p>When transitioning a new policy like RUC from concept to implementation, the administering agency of government faces many organizational needs to stand up and operate the program. This dimension considers existing organizational structures including the relationship between states’ motor vehicle administrators (often Departments of Motor Vehicles or Departments of Revenue) and the Department of Transportation, the agencies collecting the revenue, and the technical capabilities of their systems that could potentially be used for RUC.</p>
<p>High-level research of each states’ organizational structure in 2022 revealed that the Department of Motor Vehicles is part of the Department of Transportation in 17 states. In all other states, the Department of Motor Vehicles is part of another organization or is a stand-alone entity. </p>
<p>In most states, fuel tax revenue is collected by the department of revenue or taxation and vehicle revenue is collected by the Department of Motor Vehicles. In a few states, the Department of Transportation plays some role in revenue collection. </p>
<p>The Functional Analysis of Existing State Agencies’ Organizations building block can be conducted by each state to help identify the best state agencies to lead and support a RUC program and to determine what must be done to prepare these agencies for RUC. These agencies include not just the Department of Motor Vehicles or Department of Transportation, but also related agencies involved in revenue collection, such as departments of revenue or taxation, the department of treasury, and the department of information technology.</p>
<p>Any government evaluating the establishment of a new RUC program must review core organizational needs to help identify the agencies best suited for various RUC functions, including program oversight and management, and to then design an organizational structure that meets agency needs. </p>
<p>As of 2022, in Oregon and Utah, the Departments of Transportation have been responsible for RUC program management. In Virginia, the responsibility has been placed with the Department of Motor Vehicles. In most cases, Departments of Transportation play an important role in RUC programs because they are the main benefactors of RUC collection. Other agencies, such as Departments of Motor Vehicles or Departments of Revenue, may collect the vehicle registry data and fees. Separate agencies may also administer commercial and noncommercial functions. In cases in which the functions are combined, RUC implementation may be easier. When separate organizations are involved, there may be more organizational issues or hurdles to overcome. The building blocks provided in this guidebook make a distinction between the lead RUC agency and the implementing RUC agency to clearly identify the agency responsible for each function. </p>
<p>Assessing the technical capabilities and age of impacted agencies’ information technology systems is also important. Older systems may need to be modernized or interfaced with third-party solutions to support a new RUC program. Any opportunities to share the cost of collection with other programs should be evaluated, such as by developing back-end systems that support other programs. </p>

<p style="color:#fff;margin-top: 22px">These challenges and strategies, and associated building blocks are most relevant for the RUC Lead Agency during the Research &amp; Planning stage. The challenges are categorized as analytical, design, and policy and are each addressed by several strategies. </p>
<ol class="cands-list" style="margin-left: 2em">
   <li class="roundnum"><strong>&nbsp;Analytical Challenges:</strong> Also described as “myth busting”. Many challenges to RUC acceptance are based on misperceptions or assertions not supported by evidence. Analysis can help decisionmakers overcome the challenge by providing objective results that rebut a question, concern, or objection. However, objective facts may not sway an entrenched opinion.</li>
   <li class="roundnum" style="margin-top: 12px"><strong>&nbsp;Design Challenges:</strong> Many objections to RUC are legitimate and based in fact. In these cases, changes to the technical or policy design of RUC can ameliorate the problem and help decisionmakers overcome barriers.</li>   
   <li class="roundnum" style="margin-top: 12px"><strong>&nbsp;Policy Choices:</strong> Policy choices sometimes present themselves as challenges. In these cases, decisionmakers need actionable information—like the pros and cons of each choice, and sometimes even advice on how to decide—to inform their ultimate decisions.</li>
</ol>
   
<p style="color:#fff">The strategies presented are not mutually exclusive. In fact, the proposed strategies are complementary, and it may be helpful to engage several or all strategies to overcome the challenge in a given state. Where relevant, strategies for overcoming these challenges reference the RUC system stages, activities, and building blocks that are described in more detail in the RUC Building Blocks.</p>

<p>It is a common perception that RUC will disproportionately burden rural drivers, since rural trips tend to be longer than urban trips. Although this concern arises wherever RUC is proposed, concern may be greater in states with a large urban-rural divide. For example, San Francisco, California, has a significantly different urban form than Vacaville, California. In states like Montana or Wyoming, urban centers have relatively low population density, so the experience of urban and rural drivers may not be significantly different.</p>

<p> Use the results to determine the cost share of highway maintenance and operations that should be borne by different vehicle weights or classes. Recent research by The Eastern Transportation Coalition found that it is not appropriate to charge heavy-duty vehicles and passenger vehicles the same rate, nor can heavy-duty vehicles groups effectively be distinguished by MPG bands for rate-setting purposes. Distinction by weight class is the most directly proportionate to roadway maintenance costs. However, the difference in road wear caused by the lightest and heaviest vehicles within the light-duty passenger vehicle class (i.e., vehicles weighing less than 10,000 lbs.) is negligible. Variable rates among passenger vehicles are not recommended because the added administrative costs associated with a more complex rate structure may erode the additional revenue received by heavier vehicles, like pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, within that weight classification. </p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Impact on Emissions</h3>
<p>Some people have expressed concern that RUC unfairly impacts low-emissions vehicle types, specifically electric vehicles, hybrid, and high-efficiency gas-powered vehicles, which would cost more per mile to operate under a RUC than they do under the gas tax. For those expressing concern, it seems contradictory for the state to both promote adoption of electric vehicles and charge electric vehicles for road usage through a RUC system.</p>

<p>While, on a per-mile basis, gas taxes are determined entirely by vehicle fuel efficiency, households drive a different number of miles annually and these differences in total vehicle miles traveled influences total gas tax costs more than fuel efficiency. Annual household vehicle miles traveled varies widely, but the range of MPGs is relatively narrow. Since fuel taxes are a small percentage of the total price of gasoline, electric vehicles remain cheaper to operate on a per-mile basis than their gas-powered counterparts under a RUC system. When compared to the fuel tax rate, oil prices play a much bigger part in the price of fuel. A RUC with a revenue-neutral rate can be calculated by dividing the current gas tax rate by the average fuel economy of the vehicle class. At that revenue-neutral RUC rate, electric vehicles, hybrids, and other high-efficiency vehicles would retain most of the cost savings of reduced fuel use. Additionally, electric vehicles will likely reach price parity with gas-powered vehicles by the time a fully realized RUC program could realistically be implemented. </p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Cost of Administration</h3>
<p>While the gas tax is not a sustainable funding mechanism, it is administratively efficient. In most states, fuel taxes are imposed on fuel distributors and suppliers rather than directly on motorists at the pump. This method of collection limits the number of taxpayers to a few dozen or a few hundred companies rather than hundreds of thousands or millions of individual drivers. Economic research indicates that motorists bear the cost of fuel taxes “on average fully and immediately after any change in the tax rate.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a>&nbsp; In other words, companies immediately pass along the fuel costs to motorists even though it is technically levied on distributors, not directly on drivers. Since the gas tax is typically included in the total price of fuel, and not as a separate line item, the gas tax is “invisible” to many drivers.</p>
<p>The Waka Kotahi New Zealand Transport Agency, which collects and manages all RUC revenues in New Zealand, estimates that a RUC system is roughly twice as expensive to administer as the fuel excise tax.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> The cost to administer fuel excise taxes is estimated to be between 0.9% and 3%, which puts the estimated cost of RUC administration between 1.8% and 6%, a relatively wide range.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Actual costs depend on local circumstances, such as the scale of the RUC program or the presence of existing systems and processes that a RUC system could leverage to reduce costs (i.e., annual odometer readings at vehicle inspections, mileage reporting for interstate commercial motor carriers).</p>
<p>In the United States, many states used some form of a weight-distance tax for heavy-duty trucks during the 20th century. Most state weight-distance taxes were discontinued because of high administrative costs or lawsuits or threats of lawsuits from the trucking industry. As of 2022, four states have a weight-distance tax for heavy-duty vehicles: Oregon, New York, Kentucky, and New Mexico. Estimates for the cost of administration of these programs vary widely, ranging from as low as 3% to as high as 20% of gross revenues.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><sup>,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></sup> The relatively high cost of administration can be attributed to the burdensome manual reporting and recordkeeping required given the technology available at that time, as well as the structure of some programs that required weight reporting on a per-trip basis.</p>
<p>Reporting and payment can be simplified with in-vehicle telematics or online self-reporting and payment portals, while recordkeeping and billing can be streamlined using shared databases between state motor vehicle registries and departments of revenue, or by using a commercial account manager</p>
<p>Tolling, another form of revenue collection for road, bridge, and tunnel infrastructure, tends to have a higher cost of collection than both the gas tax and RUC. Precise data on the cost of administration in the tolling industries is usually not readily available. Many tolling agencies in the United States do not release financial data because it may impact the cost of capital for upcoming bond issues, bond covenant requirements, intergovernmental agreements among toll agencies, or stock prices for privately financed and publicly traded tolling agencies.<sup>3</sup> However, a report by the Washington State Department of Transportation examined the collection costs of several toll systems using electronic toll collection and found that costs ranged from 14% to 20% of revenue.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Although RUC administrative costs will come down as systems mature, RUC will likely have higher administrative costs than the gas tax, regardless of the mileage reporting method used. The success of a RUC program depends, in part, on keeping the cost of administration low. As a RUC program grows, economies of scale and cost sharing with existing programs reduce administrative costs over time.</p>

<p>Requiring prepayment provides cash flow to the agency. It also reduces transaction costs by eliminating the need for invoicing and reminders for unpaid accounts, though account statements may still be needed. When a specific number of miles is prepaid, there generally needs to be a true-up procedure by which the number of mile driven is reconciled with the number of miles prepaid; this true-up procedure may occur quarterly or annually. Some tax collection and administration systems may need to be reconfigured to support prepayment. While the notion of prepaying for RUC may be politically less acceptable than post-payment, the gas tax is also a prepayment model: vehicle owners pay the tax before they expend the fuel to drive on the roads. This analogy can make RUC prepayment more acceptable, especially since one of its policy purposes is to replace the gas tax. </p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Data Security and Privacy Protection</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges facing RUC implementation is assuring the general public that any data collected on road usage will be protected, and that personally identifiable information will not be shared with third parties. Drivers also need assurances that the government is not actively monitoring their travels. A successful RUC program needs both technical/operational measures and legal measures to ensure privacy.</p>

Commercial drivers’ choices in reporting mechanisms may be limited by the other taxes and fees they are required to remit. Review the commercial motor vehicle tax and fee structure to offer commercial drivers choices to protect their privacy as much as possible while fulfilling their reporting obligations. </p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Integration with Tolling and Congestion Pricing </h3>
<p>Many states operate tolling systems that use in-vehicle transponders tied to an account with stored banking card information to charge drivers for each transaction. While tolling (discrete) and RUC (continuous) are functionally and operationally different, drivers may perceive the two systems as similar, or view RUC as an additional inconvenience. Compatibility between the two systems may increase public acceptance of RUC and have the added benefit of improving collection rates and reducing operational costs for both RUC and tolling. Several states are studying the compatibility of the two, including Oregon.</p>
<p>A RUC system that uses location-based in-vehicle mileage reporting devices is well-positioned to leverage the technology to also collect congestion charges during certain times of the day or in certain locations. However, congestion charging initially may be a more controversial policy than RUC because it represents a new cost to motorists on top of a RUC or gas tax rather than simply replacing the gas tax.  Public acceptance of congestion pricing tends to increase over time once the benefits are made apparent to the general public. </p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Compliance and Enforcement </h3>
<p>As the gas tax is built into the price paid at the pump and is “invisible” to many drivers, there is little opportunity for evasion. RUC, however, requires some active participation from drivers via processes like enrollment, reporting, and payment. Because of this, there is greater opportunity for evasion, intentional or otherwise. Some mileage reporting methods, such as self-reported mileage, may have a greater potential for evasion. </p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Location-Based Mileage Reporting</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Location-based mileage reporting methods such as location-based OBD-II plug-in devices or vehicles with native telematics technology, offer some enhanced RUC system capabilities and operational benefits to the state as well as greater convenience to drivers over low- or no-tech mileage reporting options. Some of these benefits include the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul class="lr-ul">
<li><strong>Automatically exempts non-taxable miles, such as miles driven on private roads or out of state.</strong> This simplifies the user experience for drivers who frequent non-RUC-liable roads. These drivers would not have to manually keep track of exempt miles, reducing the need for audits as geolocated miles would be more challenging to manipulate than self-reported exempt miles (See challenges around exemptions, credits and refunds [SB1]&nbsp;and strategies for overcoming these challenges).</li>
<li><strong>Mileage reporting is automatic and secure</strong>. This reduces the administrative burden placed on drivers and, for the state, could reduce enforcement and auditing costs because automated mileage reporting methods are more difficult to manipulate than manually reported mileage (See challenges around the user experience[SB1]&nbsp; and compliance and enforcement[SB2]&nbsp; as well as strategies for overcoming these challenges).<a style="text-decoration: none !important" id="_msocom_1"></a></li>
<li><strong>Creates the opportunity to align RUC with other efforts including tolling and congestion pricing. </strong>These synergies may include tolling or the opportunity to leverage the RUC system to implement other policies, like cordon pricing, that depend on real-time vehicle location (See challenges around integration with tolling and congestion pricing[SB1]&nbsp; and around flexibility for policy adaptation[SB2]&nbsp; as well as strategies for overcoming these challenges).</li>
</ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While convenient, location-based mileage reporting methods are not without their challenges. While the price of location-based mileage plug-in reporting devices may come down at scale, they come at some cost to the driver while other mileage reporting methods have no up-front costs to the driver. Unless drivers frequently travel out of jurisdiction, the cost of the plug-in devices may be a barrier to widespread adoption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, vehicles manufactured before 1996 and some electric vehicles do not have OBD-II ports. Native telematics are only available in select newer model year vehicles and are not typically optimized by manufacturers for RUC mileage reporting. Many drivers are not comfortable sharing location data with either the state or a commercial account manager regardless of their personal needs or their vehicle’s compatibility.</p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Scalability of Systems</h3>
<p>The most efficient and cost-effective way of setting up a small-scale RUC system may not necessarily be practical or economical at scale. While a manual mileage reporting approach is a low-cost way to build the necessary systems and begin revenue collections, for example, higher-tech options that cost more up-front and may provide features needed to keep costs low at scale.</p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">User Experience </h3>
<p>As the gas tax is paid at the pump during each fill up and is not generally shown as a separate line item on signs or receipts, it is “invisible” to many drivers. A RUC, on the other hand, requires some action by drivers to report mileage and pay mileage fees. New requirements that are too burdensome may hinder the acceptance of RUC, and potentially decrease compliance. </p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Fleet Management</h3>
<p>Commercial vehicle fleet operators have different needs than individual drivers of privately owned passenger vehicles. For large fleet operators, enrolling vehicles in RUC, managing accounts, and making payments on an individual vehicle basis would be costly and time consuming. Fleet owners operate in a complex regulatory environment and may already be overwhelmed with operational and administrative requirements. Therefore, RUC enrollment, reporting, and payment should support fleet interfaces to minimize the burden on fleet operators.</p>
<p>While some fleets may already employ their own internal vehicle management systems and/or in-vehicle telematics, fleet businesses design their systems to meet their specific operational needs. As they do not design systems with RUC in mind, their capabilities with respect to RUC reporting would vary widely.</p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Evolution of Technology and Business Models</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A RUC system implemented today (or in the near future) would not be able to take full advantage of the most cost-effective methods of mileage reporting—such as in-vehicle telematics or some other unforeseen technological advancement—upon system rollout. These technologies are relatively recent advances and are only available on newer model year vehicles. While some portion of the vehicle fleet could be positioned to employ in-vehicle telematics for RUC reporting, it could take decades for the entire vehicle fleet to turn over and for this technology to be standard in all vehicles on the road. Moreover, OEMs do not necessarily have RUC at the forefront of their in-vehicle telematics research and development at present. As RUC matures, streamlined commercial account manager business practices may result in reduced administration costs.</p>

<h2 class="h2-accords" style="color: #337891;margin-bottom: 10px">POLICY CHOICES</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p><!-- /wp:pb/accordion-item --></p>
<h3 class="challenges-head">Rate Setting</h3>
<p>Rate setting is a policy choice with many impacts to consider, including differential impacts on population groups by geography and demographics, total net revenue, and ability to keep pace with costs.</p>
<p>Rate setting also impacts cost of administration in several ways. First, rate setting determines total revenue, which serves as the denominator for the popular but often misleading “cost as a percent of revenue” metric. The lower the raw cost, the lower the cost as a percent of revenue. Likewise, the higher the revenue, the lower the cost as a percent of revenue. Raising the rate of a RUC automatically reduces the cost as a percent of revenue. Because of the high variability in revenue targets and rates across tax and fee mechanisms, and across geographics, using this metric must be done cautiously.</p>
<p>Secondly, the type of rate setting impacts the complexity of the accounting system used to assess RUC charges. For example, the simplest possible configuration is to set a flat rate per-mile for all miles driven for passenger vehicles. Assessing this type of charge requires one number per vehicle per reporting period: the number of miles driven. As with the weight tax, one charge rate is multiplied by one number (miles driven) to produce the charges due. More complex rate structures could require or allow charging miles differently by location driven. This would necessarily require or allow for measuring miles by location, which increases the cost of mileage measurement technology.</p>
<p>Third, rate structures that introduce complexity often require additional customer service to explain, including additional up-front information presented in numerous formats to allow for ease of understanding and increased likelihood of initial compliance. Variable rates by vehicle type, for example, may invite customer inquiries about their individual circumstances.</p>

<p id="at-1469" class="c-accordion__title js-accordion-controller" role="button">Strategy 1: Establish a RUC rate that is revenue-neutral with the gas tax for a select portion of vehicles.</p>
<div id="ac-1469" class="c-accordion__content">
<p>This revenue-neutral rate is found by computing the average fuel economy of that portion of vehicles and dividing the current gas tax by that value. When computing the average fuel economy, use the harmonic mean, not arithmetic mean (linear average), to correctly the compute the average of different MPG calculations.</p>
<p>A RUC rate that is revenue-neutral with the gas tax is not the only approach. Higher rates could be chosen to replace some vehicle licensing fees or to generate more annual revenue for highway infrastructure than the current gas tax. Choosing a rate that is revenue-neutral with the gas tax to start should prevent discussion of tax increases or of double taxation but may not provide enough funding if gas tax revenues are already insufficient.</p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Transition</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>No RUC program for passenger vehicles covers all vehicles in a jurisdiction. The world’s largest, most mature program in New Zealand has gradually grown to 800,000 diesel passenger and commercial vehicles and over 150,000 heavy-duty vehicles over a period of decades. Meanwhile, Utah and Oregon continue to study alternatives for transitioning their current small-scale programs from electric and high-MPG vehicles to more vehicles. The transition from a small-scale start-up program to a larger-scale program is one every state with a RUC program will face.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>RUC can be rolled out for different passenger vehicle types on different timelines. For example, some states focus on implementing RUC for electric vehicles first before including all passenger vehicle types. Another potential strategy is to introduce RUC for all new vehicles starting with a certain model year. Then, there is a 15- to 20-year transition to a RUC as the vehicle fleet turns over.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Depending on a state’s characteristics, it may be beneficial to consider advancing RUC for passenger vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles at different paces. While New Zealand introduced RUC for all diesel vehicles (heavy-duty and passenger vehicles) from the outset, RUC programs in the U.S. have focused on passenger vehicles first. Many Western European countries, however, rolled out road user fees for heavy-duty vehicles first. This may be, in part, due to different program goals. In Western Europe, user fees on heavy-duty trucks are intended to curb carbon emissions, while in the U.S., RUC is intended as a funding mechanism.</p>
<p>The choice of how to transition and the final delivery configuration for a RUC system will impact costs, timetable for system implementation, risks, and complexity.</p>
<div class="wp-block-pb-accordion-item c-accordion__item js-accordion-item no-js" data-initially-open="false" data-click-to-close="true" data-auto-close="true" data-scroll="false" data-scroll-offset="0">
<p id="at-1473" class="c-accordion__title js-accordion-controller" role="button">Strategy 1: Phase out the gas tax gradually.</p>
<div id="ac-1473" class="c-accordion__content">
<p>A gradual transition allows for a small-scale program to learn, establish rules, build and test processes and systems, train staff, and grow familiarity with customers and the communications they need to comply in the most cost-effective manner. Sudden transitions that require agencies to scale programs to handle large numbers of vehicles risk high costs, revenue losses, and public relations incidents. Gradual transitions can manage risks more effectively.</p>
<p>A gradual transition can begin with electric vehicles only, which do not pay any gas tax. As gas-powered vehicles are phased in, some form of rebate, credit, or exemption will be necessary to avoid double taxation:</p>
<ul class="lorem" style="margin-left: 30px">
<li><b>Refunds:</b> Drivers who pay RUC and purchase gasoline are issued a refund in the amount of the fuel tax paid. The process may be similar to existing processes for refunding fuel taxes for fuel used off of public roads. Refunds may be expensive to process, so it may be better to offer credits.</li>
<li><b>Credits:</b> In lieu of returning money to drivers, a credit in the value of the fuel tax paid is applied to the RUC account for that specific vehicle. If the fuel tax credit were insufficient to pay RUC, the driver would be responsible for paying the difference. For example, electric vehicles pay no fuel tax and would not receive a credit. If fuel tax credits exceed the total RUC due, drivers pay nothing. Excess credits are typically not refunded except when a vehicle is sold or moves out of state.</li>
<li><b>Exemptions:</b> An exemption works by deducting the value of the fuel tax from the total fuel price paid at the point of purchase. This would only apply to vehicles that are charged RUC, so at the time and point of purchase, the gas station would need to identify that the vehicle being fueled is subject to RUC (and has been paying RUC) to obtain the exemption. Because fuel taxes are paid by distributors, administrative procedures would need to be established to ensure exemptions at the retail level were addressed at the distribution level of fuel supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>All approaches would require identifying which vehicles are subject to RUC and then directly linking and measuring all sales and distribution of taxable fuel to those vehicles to enable calculation of refunds, credits, and exemptions.</p>

<p>A transition strategy should lay out, in advance, the final end state to which the program aspires to assure that the steps taken in transition lead to the aspiration rather than to a dead end. The optimal transition pathway for expanding a small initial RUC program to a full program over time depends on the preferred final RUC system delivery configuration.</p>
<p>The final-state configuration of how a RUC is collected and administered is informed by a state’s guiding principles for business case evaluation of RUC concept. Depending on the mileage tracking method selected and the state’s existing operational and administrative capabilities, the optimal RUC delivery configuration may be government agencies only, a single private sector service provider, an open-market private sector service provider, or some combination of public and private sector.</p>
<p>The final delivery configuration for a RUC system will impact costs, timetable for system implementation, risks, and complexity. While it may be possible to deliver a RUC system in its final end state from the beginning, it may not be practical to do so. The complexity and cost of delivering a fully mature RUC program may make a simpler approach—like beginning with an initial, short-term configuration and adding more vehicles over time—more prudent at the start.</p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Refunds, Credits, and Exemptions</h3>
<p>Under a RUC system, exemptions, credits, or refunds may be necessary. These include constitutional or statutory requirements, lack of nexus between the tax or fee purpose and the entity or activity being taxed, and other policy considerations. Some reasons for issuing exemptions, credits, or refunds include:</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle class:</strong> Exempted vehicle types could include transit vehicles, foreign diplomatic or consular mission vehicles, or publicly owned vehicles like fire trucks or maintenance vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Mileage class:</strong> Exempted mileage classes could include miles driven out of jurisdiction or off public roads. For example, some drivers frequently drive out of state. Others drive RUC-liable, passenger vehicles (e.g., farm trucks or off-road vehicles) that are frequently used on nonpublic roads.</p>
<p><strong>Avoiding double taxation:</strong> A gas tax is likely to remain in effect during the transition to a RUC. To avoid double taxation, some form of rebate, credit, exemption, or refund will be necessary.</p>

<p id="at-1480" class="c-accordion__title js-accordion-controller" role="button">Strategy 5: If the gas tax remains during a transition to RUC, identify an approach to exempt, refund, or issue credits to RUC-paying drivers on gas taxes paid.</p>
<div id="ac-1480" class="c-accordion__content">
<ul class="lorem" style="margin-left: 30px">
<li><b>Refunds:</b> Drivers who pay RUC and purchases gasoline are issued a refund in the amount of the fuel tax paid. The process may be similar to existing processes for refunding fuel taxes for fuel used off of public roads. Refunds may be expensive to process, so it may be better to offer credits.</li>
<li><b>Credits:</b> In lieu of returning money to drivers, apply a credit in the value of the fuel tax paid to the RUC account for that specific vehicle. If the fuel tax credit were insufficient to pay RUC, the driver would be responsible for paying the difference. For example, electric vehicles pay no fuel tax, so drivers would not receive a credit). If fuel tax credits exceed the total RUC due, drivers pay nothing. Excess credits are typically not refunded except when a vehicle is sold or moves out of state.</li>
<li><b>Exemptions:</b> An exemption works by deducting the value of the fuel tax from the total fuel price paid at the point of purchase. This would only apply to vehicles that are charged RUC, so at the time and point of purchase, the gas station would need to identify that the vehicle being fueled is subject to RUC (and has been paying RUC) to obtain the exemption. Because fuel taxes are paid by distributors, establish administrative procedures to ensure exemptions at the retail level were addressed at the distribution level of fuel supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>All approaches would require identifying which vehicles are subject to RUC and then directly linking and measuring all sales and distribution of taxable fuel to those vehicles to enable calculation of refunds, credits, and exemptions.</p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Constitutional Issues</h3>
<p>The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce and this power places a dormant restraint on the ability of any state to regulate or tax interstate commerce. Nevertheless, when Congress is silent with regard to an area of commerce, the states have certain abilities to place impositions on interstate commerce, especially regarding taxation.</p>
<p>Amendment V of the U.S. Constitution states that a person cannot be deprived of liberty without due process of law. As interpreted by the Supreme Court, this guarantees the right to travel between states without excessive burden. This interpretation is closely related, although not identical, to the Court’s nexus requirement for taxation of interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p>Over time, the Supreme Court has developed a four-factor test for examining whether a state taxation scheme violates the dormant Commerce Clause. As decided in the Supreme Court case Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady<a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>, a state’s tax on interstate commerce will not violate the dormant Commerce Clause so long as the tax:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 3em">
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ol style="margin-left: 3em"><!-- wp:paragraph --></ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol style="margin-left: 3em">
<li>applies to an activity within a substantial nexus with the taxing state,</li>
<li>&nbsp; is fairly apportioned,</li>
<li>&nbsp;does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and</li>
<li>&nbsp;is fairly related to the service the state provides.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most RUC system configurations do not impact rights under the U.S. Constitution. However, depending on how a system is designed to handle RUC and/or gas taxes for nonresidents, care must be taken not to violate the nondiscrimination test of the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p>At the state level, transportation revenues are often legally restricted to transportation or highway-related purposes only. In many states, the use of revenue for transportation purposes only is restricted by state constitutional provisions.</p>

<h3 class="challenges-head">Flexibility for Policy Adaptation</h3>
<p>States face many other social, economic, and environmental transportation-related issues in addition to infrastructure funding. Some include greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, land use, stormwater runoff, petroleum dependence, economic inequality, divergent transportation needs between urban and rural residents, congestion, and effects on small businesses. However, there is rarely consensus among policymakers about a given issue’s impact and relative importance.</p>

<div id="ac-1487" class="c-accordion__content">
<p>Because a RUC system creates a direct linkage between the vehicle owner, the vehicle’s characteristics, and payment in direct proportion to actual use, RUC is more capable than the gas tax of being tailored to reflect other public policies or priorities. Even if specific policies have not identified at the time of implementation, RUC is flexible enough to be tailored across three dimensions:</p>
<ul class="lorem" style="margin-left: 30px">
<li><b>Vehicle owner characteristics.</b> For example, the RUC program could apply a different per-mile rate based on where the owner resides, perhaps to reflect the higher or lower cost of roadway infrastructure in certain parts of the state.</li>
<li><b>Vehicle characteristics.</b> For example, a small surcharge could be applied to “gas guzzlers,” similar to federal policy regarding low-MPG passenger vehicles.</li>
<li><b>Vehicle use.</b> For example, different RUC rates could be applied to ride-share vehicles.</li>
