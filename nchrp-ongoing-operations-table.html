<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As vehicles become more fuel efficient and the rate of electric vehicle adoption increases, less fuel is being purchased, resulting in less revenue for states to maintain their transportation infrastructure. The link between how much drivers use the roads and how much they pay for them has become broken, with some users contributing nothing to transportation funding. As a result, states are studying different funding alternatives to identify more long-term sustainable sources of revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While many alternatives exist, states are coalescing around a promising source of sustainable funding—a road usage charge (RUC), which allows for all users of the transportation system to help pay for it. A RUC is also commonly referred to as a mileage-based user fee (MBUF), a vehicle miles traveled fee (VMT), or a distance-based fee (DBF). This research uses the term RUC.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Transitioning from the fuel tax, a source of revenue used in this country for more than 100 years, involves a fundamental examination in the way we pay for surface transportation infrastructure. It involves considerable research and experimentation, as well as problem-solving, policy development, and public outreach. Many states have begun exploring ways to implement RUC, but as of 2022, only three states (Oregon, Utah, and Virginia) have enacted a RUC program. All of these states have chosen to incrementally deploy RUC and have begun a migration to distance-based charging for certain classes of eligible vehicles. As more states study RUC, identifying implementation successes and challenges from existing RUC programs will aid states in their quest to find sustainable transportation funding. Adding to the complexity of this challenge is the recognition that the fuel tax has two components: the state motor fuel tax and the federal motor fuel tax, each collected by separate authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To help states navigate this complex landscape, this National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) report extracts best practices from RUC programs around the world into actionable building blocks and implementation pathways. Additionally, this report assesses the unique challenges to implementing RUC programs and identifies strategies that may be successful in overcoming them. This report is intended to be used as a resource that states can use to navigate the RUC implementation process as they seek to achieve their transportation funding goals. Finally, this report focuses on state RUC and does not address federal RUC, which will be explored in the proposed National RUC Pilot through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most road pricing projects and programs progress through the following four stages:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Research &amp; Planning</strong> – This stage comprises all RUC activities prior to the passing of legislation; this includes research, planning, and outreach. Any pre-legislative pilot or demonstration is included in this stage, including technical design and operations work. Otherwise, the focus of this stage is developing policy, performing financial analyses, establishing communication and outreach activities, and supporting the passage of legislation. Many activities that begin in the research and planning stage continue in later stages.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Setup</strong> – This stage begins with the passage of legislation to create a voluntary or mandatory RUC program, and it continues until the program starts live operations. Much of the activity in this stage involves specifying, procuring, and testing the RUC system. This stage also includes developing program communications, organizational design, and customer service activities to ensure a smooth program launch. Some activities that begin in this stage continue in later stages of the RUC program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ongoing Operations</strong> – This stage begins when the RUC program goes live and continues thereafter. It involves live operations of the RUC system and includes all activities related to system operations, system reporting and evaluation, and enforcement.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Transitioning &amp; Growing</strong> – This stage occurs in parallel with other stages. Some transitioning and growing activities may begin as early as the research and planning or setup stage. These activities continue even as the program enters live operations as the RUC program expands. This stage involves all activities relating to planning for the growth of the RUC program and the transition from current funding mechanisms to RUC. Achieving transition and growth requires policy and operational planning, economic forecasting activities, and collaboration with other jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within each stage, building blocks are grouped into the second tier of classification: activities. Activities are groups of related building blocks that, when taken together, achieve common objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most building blocks would be completed by the lead RUC agency identified for each state, but some could be completed by other entities, such as state legislators or partner agencies. Some building blocks, especially in the ongoing operations stage, involve continuous activity (live operations). However, the majority involve an initial significant amount of work, typically over several weeks or months, resulting in a recommendation or a document. Such building blocks may not have additional activities for months or years but may be later revisited in an update to the original work. It is likely that many building blocks will be revisited, either in the same stage or in later stages of development; a few building blocks may only be performed once.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of the building blocks are necessary to achieve a successful RUC program, regardless of whether their activity is explicitly considered a part of program work. However, some building blocks have proven to be less essential for implementation of a successful RUC program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The building blocks are intended to be used beyond this study as a detailed, yet rapidly comprehensible, taxonomy to identify and define the work needed to implement a RUC program. Jurisdictions wanting to research and potentially implement a RUC program should find the building blocks useful as a high-level guide on how to get started on specific activities in a RUC program. The building blocks can be used as a starting point for implementation. Hopefully, reviewing the list of building blocks will spark ideas for additional activities that could be included in a RUC program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These building blocks are meant to provide guidance to states and agencies exploring RUC; however, completing all of the building blocks within each stage may not be necessary. States should determine which stage they are in and complete the building blocks deemed most relevant given their states’ needs. States may determine the specific order they complete the building blocks within each stage.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RUC for commercial vehicles, including medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, may need separate implementation processes. These vehicles are frequently administered by different agencies than passenger vehicles and, so, may use different systems and procedures. While specific mention has been made in some building blocks, they all may apply to commercial vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
